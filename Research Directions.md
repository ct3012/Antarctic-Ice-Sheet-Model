# Research Directions:

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is an area in the Antarctica that has been shown to be especially vulnerable to global warming (Venturelli, 2020). Therefore, tracking the grounding line, the boundary between grounded and floating ice, of the WAIS is of significance for the preservation of the ice sheet. When the grounding line advances, it increases the ice sheet’s area and volume above the flotation to prevent the ice sheet from having large areas of contact with the warm Circumpolar Deep Water (Kingslake et al., 2018). In fact, the marine ice sheet instability hypothesis asserts the necessity of grounding line stability for ice sheet stability, and multiple processes, such as sea level, ocean temperature, and sediment accumulation, have been proposed to influence its stability (Venturelli, 2020).

Kinsgslake et al. (2018) revealed in their model that both the grounding line region and buttressing are the key for grounding line readvancement. Therefore, mantle viscosity is predicted to be one of the most important parameters for grounding line readvancement. In the lowest viscosity (1e20Pa s) scenario, the resulting grounding line was more advanced compared to the present, but no readvancement was observed because the lithosphere deformed too quickly (Kingslake et al., 2018). In the highest viscosity (1e21Pa s), grounding line retreat occured the earliest and readvance occured the slowest. Therefore, I predict that the lowest possible viscosity that is capable of readvancement will produce the largest grounding line readvancement.

I also hypothesize that the lowest value for SSA enhancement factor, which produces slower ice streams and thicker ice shelves, and the highest value for SIA enhancement factor, which produces thinner grounded ice, will result in the largest grounding line readvancement. This hypothesis is also in align with the trend depicted in Figure 7 b and c in Kingslake et al. (2018).

Furthermore, a larger isostatic rebound is produced with larger mass removed from above the oceanic lithosphere in a short period of time (Kingslake et al., 2018). Therefore, I predict that decrease in eustatic sea level after retreat of grounding line amplifies the uplift of the lithosphere and supports readvancement of the grounding line.

There were some noticeable features for other parameters as well, but I could not identify internal consistency in the trends. Additional simulations are required for a deeper understanding of the effects of the unmentioned parameters.

The parameters of interst will be investigated through Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) simulations. I will plot out glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) rates, grounding line positions, and ice sheet volumes at different sectors in different time series to identify the influence of each parameter. Furthermore, I will plot out profiles of ice surface and bed height along flow lines for different simulations and time series to examine the outcomes of the lowest SSA enhancement factor and the highest SIA factor.
