# Research Directions:

Grounding line readvancement occurs when isostatic rebound causes the lithosphere under ice shelves to rise and buttresses the ice above. Readvancement of the grounding line is especially important for the preservation of the Antarctic Ice Sheet because it can prevent warm Circumpolar Deep Water from having contact with the base of the ice sheets and converting grounded ice sheets into unstable ice shelves. Increase in ice shelves increases the iceâ€™s contact area with the warm deep water, and the additional melting causes calving and further retreat of the grounding line.

Both the grounding line region and buttressing are the key for grounding line readvancement. Therefore, mantle viscosity is predicted to be one of the most important parameters for grounding line readvancement. In the lowest viscosity (1e20Pa s) scenario, the resulting grounding line was more advanced compared to the present, but no readvancement is observed because the lithosphere deforms too quickly. In the highest viscosity (1e21Pa s), grounding line retreat occurs the earliest and readvance occurs the slowest. Therefore, I predict that the lowest possible viscosity that is capable of readvancement will produce the largest grounding line readvancement.

I also hypothesize that the lowest value for SSA enhancement factor, which produces slower ice streams and thicker ice shelves, and the highest value for SIA enhancement factor, which produces thinner grounded ice, will result in the largest grounding line readvancement. This hypothesis is also in align with the trend depicted in Figure 7 b and c in Kingslake et al. (2018).

Furthermore, a larger isostatic rebound is produced with larger mass removed from above the oceanic lithosphere in a short period of time, I predict that decrease in eustatic sea level after retreat of grounding line amplifies the uplift of the lithosphere and support readvancement of the grounding line.

There were some noticeable features for other parameters as well, but I could not identify internal consistency in the trends. Additional simulations are required for a deeper understanding of the effects of the unmentioned parameters.
